STARGAZING by Myles Smith

Time stood still, just like a photograph 
You made me feel, like this would last forever
Looking in your eyes, I see my whole life
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
They say you know it when you know it and I know
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Promise that you'll hold me close, don't let me go

TAKE MY HEART, DON'T BREAK IT
Love me to my boneesss
All this time I've wasted, you were right there all along.
